This is an ongoing effort to create a Python package that can recover a C++ type hierarchy based on the DWARF
information generated by a C++ compiler.

==========
How to use
==========

Current dirty instructions to see this working::

    pipenv install
    pipenv shell
    g++ -Wall -c -g -fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types -o types.o types.cpp
    python main.py types.o

For the moment you will have to use a debugger to take  a look at the produced output (soon with proper dumping).
